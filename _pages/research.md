**Estimating Treatment Complementarity**
>How can we estimate the complementarity between two treatments in experimental settings with imperfect compliance? The first part of this paper shows that the standard econometric approach---two-stage least squares (2SLS) with instruments for each treatment and their interaction---is often not suitable for estimating treatment interaction effects. Specifically, 2SLS requires strong assumptions on (1) treatment effect heterogeneity and (2) types of compliers. I show that these assumptions have testable implications, and these often fail in published empirical studies on complementarity. The second part proposes an alternative estimation strategy for cases where the restrictive assumptions are likely to fail and 2SLS is not viable. Building on the literature on marginal treatment effects, this approach models potential outcomes as a linear function of individuals’ unobserved resistance to treatment and offers a clearer connection to the intended estimand of treatment interaction. Lastly, the paper revisits published empirical studies on treatment complementarity.

**New Data on War on Poverty Programs in the 1960s** with Esra Kose, Henry Manley and Doug Miller.
>We introduce a new data source on the War on Poverty programs from 1965-1969, using a collection of newly discovered and digitized Poverty Program Information (PPI) books. This grant-level data set has four primary contributions. First, it includes the name of each grant recipient, the type of program funded, and the amount of funding that was appropriated. Second, it indicates whether the grant coverage was nationwide, multiple state, individual county, or for multiple counties. Multiple county program listings provide information about the recipient counties by local agencies for the first time. Third, for several programs, it provides novel information on enrollment. Finally, it includes information on a new set of War on Poverty programs that have not been previously studied due to lack of data.

**Parental Gender Norms and College Major Choice** with Chulhee Lee and Seojung Oh.
>Why do women sort into “female” majors? This paper investigates whether parental gender norms affect a child’s choice of college major in Korea. As an index of parental son preference, we use the sex ratios at birth (SRB) in the parent’s province of birth that resulted from differential rates of sex-selective abortions across regions. We find that having fathers with more traditional gender norms tend to increase the probability of the daughters’ enrollment in a female-dominated major, such as education and home economics. However, this relationship is no longer found for recent cohorts who entered college after 2000. No significant effect is observed for sons, and only weak influence of maternal gender norms is found. We offer two possible explanations for the diminished influence of parental gender norms among the younger generations, namely, increasing labor-market disadvantage associated with female-dominated majors and convergence in parental preference on sons’ and daughters’ occupations. Our results show that conventional gender stereotype in Korea played a role in shaping segregated choice of major by gender through cultural transmission, and that its influence became weaker over time.

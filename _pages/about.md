Hi, I am Hyewon Kim (pronounced: _Hae-one Kim_). I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/hyewon-kim) at Cornell University, and I am also affiliated with the [Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy](https://www.publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/hyewon-kim/). 

My research is in labor economics and applied econometrics. I develop methods to analyze policies and use data to understand how policies affect disadvantaged populations.

Here is my [CV](files/CV_Hyewon_Kim.pdf), my [research tab](/research), and my [teaching tab](/teaching).

You can reach me at: [hk935@cornell.edu](mailto:hk935@cornell.edu)

I am advised by [Doug Miller](https://economics.cornell.edu/douglas-miller), [Zhuan Pei](https://peizhuan.github.io/), and [Evan Riehl](https://evanriehl.github.io/).
